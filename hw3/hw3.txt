ou can use all wiring, gates, plexers and memory circuit, only adder and shifter in arithmetic circuits

You need 1 adder(32bit) and 1 shifter(64bit) for datapath part. (lecture5/page12)

If you design adder & shifter own, you take bonus point.

Your report file include datapath design, control unit design, least 6 test cases. 

Hints: 

circuit file (.circ) can be include more than one circuit design (we shown in ps hour)
It can be useful create test set for all circuit files. 
Submission format must be as follows:

StudentNo.zip  ->  StudentNo (folder) -> control.circ, datapath.circ, mult32.circ, Report_hw2.pdf
